    options: [
      "Expository teaching",
      "Problem-based learning",
      "Direct instruction",
      "Rote learning"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Problem-based learning presents learners with a situation and encourages them to investigate and find solutions independently or collaboratively. Here, the teacher initiates learning with a demonstration and then shifts responsibility to students to design experiments, promoting inquiry, critical thinking, and exploration. This goes beyond direct instruction or rote learning."

      "Experiential",
      "Logical"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Experiential knowledge is acquired through direct personal experience and interaction with the environment. Seeing colours or observing phenomena involves learning through experience. Intuitive, reasoned, and logical knowledge rely on instinct or thinking processes, whereas experiential knowledge is rooted in direct sensory experience."

    correctAnswer: 2,

    explanation:
      "Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis and explained the psyche using id, ego and super ego.
